🧠 Copilot Helper Notes – Please Follow These Guidelines:

This is a beginner-friendly project. Suggestions should:
- Use plain JavaScript (no frameworks, Canvas, or game libraries).
- Use `fetch()` with `.then()` syntax (not async/await unless requested).
- Prefer `const` and `let`, and keep variable/function names clear and descriptive.
- Use `||` and `&&` in conditionals only when needed – clarity first.
- Break logic into small, readable functions when appropriate.
- Avoid advanced ES6+ features (e.g., destructuring, optional chaining) unless scaffolded.
- Avoid arrow functions unless needed for clarity or brevity.
- Add helpful inline comments, especially around tricky logic or new patterns.

This helps students learn to read, debug, and extend code confidently.
